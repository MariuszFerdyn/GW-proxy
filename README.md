## ICAP server OVA

- Download OVA file from [here](https://glasswall-sow-ova.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/vms/ICAP-Server/ICAP-Rancher.ova?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA3NUU5XSYVTP3BV6R%2F20201123%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201123T102934Z&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=cb80de0b9739a122ac0f270fdbed6b1ffdc81dd6e538a4cbc97780b127949cde)

- Open VirtualBox and import downloaded OVA file: icap-Rancher.ova

- Once OVA is imported, go to Settings>Network>Adapter 2 
 
  `Name: VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter`

  `Attached to: Host-Only Adapter`

- Start ICAP Server VM

- Login (username: **user**, password: **secret**)

- In command line shell, type:
  
  `ip a show eth1`
​
- Check the ip address for eth1 (this address to be used in the following step)

- On your localhost machine (make sure you have c-icap-client installed) run below command to test the connectivity to ICAP server:

  `c-icap-client -i 192.168.56.97`

- Expected results: The command should respond with 200 OK.

- You can also verify that server is working correctly by rebuilding a file:

  `c-icap-client -f ./test.pdf -i 192.168.56.97  -p 1344 -s gw_rebuild -o rebuilt.pdf -v`

## Glasswall Engineering OVA
​
Glasswall Engineering OVA for demoing Glasswall Rebuild engine proxy for **engineering.glasswallsolutions.com** website

### Make sure that ICAP Server OVA is imported into VM and is started. Glasswall Enfineering OVA is dependent on previous one.
- Download OVA file from [here](https://glasswall-sow-ova.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/vms/Engineering-website/glasswall-engineering.ova?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA3NUU5XSYVTP3BV6R/20201123/eu-west-1/s3/aws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201123T103128Z&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=81014796a8554b5847e4d844530e578b4782ea7f10859113c5b1bd03d984322e)

- Open VirtualBox and import downloaded OVA file: glasswall-engineering.ova

- Once OVA is imported, go to Settings>Network>Adapter 2 
 
  `Name: VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter`

  `Attached to: Host-Only Adapter`

- Start Glasswall Engineering VM
​
- Login (username: **user**, password: **secret**)
​​​
- Open any browser (preferably Firefox) and try to access: [engineering.glasswallsolutions.com.local.glasswall-icap.com](https://engineering.glasswallsolutions.com.local.glasswall-icap.com)
  
- To avoid SSL Certificate warning on your host machine run:

  `scp user@192.168.56.96:/home/user/ca.pem ca.pem`

  `Import ca.pem certificate in Firefox under Options > View Certificates > Authorithies tab`
  
  `For Chrome this will not work since cert needs to be added on the system`
  
- Navigate to Documentation tab > Sample Files and try to download pdf file and verify that file has "Glasswall Approved" watermark
